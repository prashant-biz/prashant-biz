# PRASHANT KUMAR

I document workflows and governance patterns for enterprise review.

All repositories contain documentation and examples only. No code, systems, or implementations are included.

## What I Focus On

- Workflow governance documentation
- Evidence-based decision path mapping
- Governance patterns for enterprise review
- Structured documentation for compliance teams

## What's in My Repositories

Each repository contains examples and documentation demonstrating governance thinking:

**No executable code. No operational systems. No production artifacts.**

All repositories are documentation-only. Implementation and deployment responsibility remain with adopting organizations.

*All governance authority, policy decisions, and implementation responsibility remain with the deploying organization.*
