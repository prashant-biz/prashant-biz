**I document AI systems so Finance, IT, and Risk can evaluate them independently.**  
**When board asks "Can you explain this decision?" — the answer is documented.**

```

**Core Problem Solved:**  
Enterprise AI implementations stall in governance review because decision paths, ownership boundaries, and failure handling are implicit. I make them explicit through structured documentation.

**Target Stakeholders:**  
Finance Directors, Risk Officers, Internal Audit, Compliance Leads, Product Managers evaluating AI systems.

## 📊 Architecture Principle

**Three-Layer Governance Model:**

```
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  AI ADVISORY    │  ← Probabilistic, Read-only
    │     LAYER       │
    └────────┬────────┘
             │ 
             │ Classification Output
             │
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    │    DECISION     │  ← Where AI stops,
    │    BOUNDARY     │     Controls decide
    └────────┬────────┘
             │
             │ Rule-Based Logic
             │
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    │   EXECUTION     │  ← Deterministic,
    │     LAYER       │     Auditable
    └────────┬────────┘
             │
             │ Evidence Logged
             │
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    │  REVIEW SYSTEM  │  ← Human Oversight
    └─────────────────┘
```

**Key Principles:**
1. AI advises → never decides
2. Rules enforce → deterministic boundaries
3. Humans review → exception handling
4. Evidence logs → full traceability

## 🔬 Design Philosophy

<details>
<summary><b>📜 On Governance Documentation</b></summary>
<br>

- Documentation is architecture, not afterthought
- Failure paths must be designed, not hidden as exceptions
- Audit trails tell stories, not just log events
- If you cannot trace a decision, you cannot defend it

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚙️ On Workflow Design</b></summary>
<br>

- The person doing work rarely documents it
- Remove friction from correct behavior, not shortcuts
- Surface ambiguity rather than guess accuracy
- Design for reality under pressure, not ideal conditions

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 On Specifications</b></summary>
<br>

- Specifications must be implementable, not theoretical
- Workflows must be independently reviewable
- Trade-offs must be explicit
- Show the decision, not just the outcome

</details>

## 🤝 Who I Work With

| Stakeholder | Problem | Documentation Delivered |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Risk & Compliance** | "Can you prove this AI decision was correct?" | Traceable decision paths with audit evidence |
| **Finance Directors** | "How do we automate without losing control?" | Deterministic workflows with ownership matrices |
| **Product Leaders** | "Will this pass board review?" | Review-ready specifications with failure modes |
| **Operations Managers** | "Field teams don't document in real-time" | Voice-driven workflows with validation |
| **Engineering Leads** | "Our automation breaks under edge cases" | Agentic patterns designed for degradation |

## 📊 Repository Overview

```
Total Repositories:  5 core + 1 profile
Focus:               Workflow Governance • AI Documentation • Field Operations
Approach:            Review-Ready • Evidence-Based • Pressure-Tested
Artifacts:           Execution Maps • Decision Tables • Evidence Templates
```

**Structure:**
- Each repo contains implementation-ready artifacts
- Documentation designed for non-technical review
- Trade-offs documented explicitly
- Failure modes mapped with ownership

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

**The Gap:**  
Most AI systems fail governance review because decision logic is implicit.

**The Solution:**  
Structured documentation that makes decisions independently reviewable.

**The Outcome:**  
AI systems that:
- Pass board review without revision
- Survive regulatory audit
- Scale without losing traceability
- Degrade gracefully under pressure
