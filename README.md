**I design AI systems that survive board review.**  
**When Finance, IT, and Risk ask "Can you explain this decision?" — the answer is yes.**

**Specialization:**  
Making opaque AI systems inspectable, traceable, and defensible for high-stakes enterprise environments.

**Problem I Solve:**  
Most AI implementations fail governance review not from technical weakness, but because decision logic, ownership, and failure paths were never made explicit.

## 🔬 Design Philosophy

<details>
<summary><b>On AI and Governance</b></summary>
<br>

- Governance is **architecture**, not a compliance checkbox
- Failure paths must be **designed**, not exceptions handled silently
- Audit trails should **tell a story**, not just log timestamps
- If you cannot **trace a decision**, you cannot **defend it**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>On Workflow Design</b></summary>
<br>

- The person **doing the work** is rarely the person **documenting it**
- Remove friction from the **right behavior**, not from the wrong one
- **Ambiguity surfaced** beats **accuracy guessed**
- Design for **reality under pressure**, not ideal conditions

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>On Documentation & Specifications</b></summary>
<br>

- Spec work that isn't **implementable** is just text
- Workflows should be **independently reviewable** by non-technical stakeholders
- Trade-offs must be **explicit**; hidden limitations destroy trust
- **Show the decision, not just the outcome**

</details>

    style D fill:#e8f5e9
```

**Three-Layer Architecture:**
1. **AI Classifies** → Read-only, advisory, probabilistic
2. **Controls Decide** → Deterministic, rule-based, auditable
3. **Humans Review** → Exception handling, policy override, continuous learning
