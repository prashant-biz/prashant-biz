# Workflow Governance Systems

**Governance Consultant | Workflow Architecture | AI Accountability Design**

I work at the intersection of workflow complexity and organizational trust. My focus: making AI-driven processes inspectable, reviewable, and defensible for Finance, IT, and Risk teams.

## The Core Problem

Most AI systems fail governance review not because they're weak, but because **decision paths are opaque**. When an AI system makes a choice, can you trace it? Can you replay it? Can you prove it was deterministic?

I design workflows where:
- **AI classifies** (read-only, advisory)
- **Controls decide** (deterministic, auditable)
- **Failure modes are named, owned, and logged**

## Pinned Repositories

Each repository demonstrates a governance principle through specification, implementation notes, and audit patterns.

## Philosophy

**On AI and Governance:**
- Governance is architecture, not policy compliance checkbox
- Failure paths must be designed, not exceptions handled silently
- Audit trails should tell a story, not just log timestamps
- If you cannot trace a decision, you cannot defend it

**On Workflow Design:**
- The person doing the work is rarely the person documenting it
- Remove friction from the right behavior, not from the wrong one
- Ambiguity surfaced beats accuracy guessed

**On Documentation:**
- Spec work that isn't implementable is just text
- Workflows should be independently reviewable by non-technical stakeholders
- Trade-offs must be explicit; hidden limitations destroy trust

## Who This Is For

- **Risk & Compliance:** Building audit-ready AI systems
- **Finance Teams:** Automating high-stakes processes (AP, GL, reconciliation)
- **Product Leaders:** Designing AI features that pass review
- **Operations:** Eliminating manual documentation through voice and automation
- **Engineering:** Building systems that aren't brittle when reality gets messy

---

## Recent Focus

Currently working on:
- Deterministic workflow patterns for SaaS AI systems
- Decision boundary specifications for risk-controlled automation
- Voice AI architecture for field operations
- Agentic systems that degrade gracefully under ambiguity

## Let's Talk

If you're:
- Building AI systems that need to pass a board review
- Designing workflows that survive real-world noise
- Automating processes where "I can't trace this" is not an acceptable answer
